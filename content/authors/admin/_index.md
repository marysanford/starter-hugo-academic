I am a PhD candidate in Social Data Science at the Oxford Internet Institute. My research pertains to the application of natural language processing, computational linguistics, and cognitive science to study online environmental communication. My PhD research is funded by the ESRC's Grand Union Doctoral Training Partnership, as part of the Advanced Quantitative Methods pathway. I have work experience in international policy research, business technology, financial management, and defense research.
